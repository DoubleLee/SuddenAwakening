SuddenAwakening
===============

A 2D game, with Original Zelda like elements.  Unique Story.  Uses c++11 cross platform code, and SFML.


Compiling

You must have the SFML 2.1 libraries and headers to compile this project.

We use QtCreator, simply open the newest version of QtCreator.
Select File-> open file or project-> in the file menu, navigate to the Source directory and open the .pro file.
On windows you should also be able to double click the .pro file and have it launch QtCreator.

Setting up a compiler tool chain is up to you.  Google for help, and check the documentation.
